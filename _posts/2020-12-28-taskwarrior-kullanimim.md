1) adindan anlasildigi gibi acil ve su goturmez sekilde oncelikli
2) This is the spot where you are focused not on problems (as with Q1) but on
   opportunities and growth
3) Urgent but Not Important tasks are best described as busy work. These tasks
   are often based on expectations set by others and do not move you closer to
   your long-term goals.
   Uzak durmak icin bazi oneriler;
   - Turn off notifications on your phone and computer when working
   - Be clear with others about how much time you can spend on a given task
   - Save Q3 tasks for times when you are very low on energy rather than putting
     them first thing in the morning
   - Negotiate your workload with your boss
   - Practice saying no
